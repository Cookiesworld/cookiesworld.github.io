# Professional Scrum Master PSM I certificate

 ![PSM I Badge](/assets/images/professional-scrum-master-i-psm-i.png){:.image-left} I am excited to share that I have successfully passed the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification from [Scrum.org](https://www.credly.com/badges/5ecdd86a-8176-4b86-8881-501cd7f8cb67/public_url). With this certification I have proven a fundamental level of Scrum knowledge! 

## How I prepared

My preparation combined structured learning and self-study:

* Two-Day Agile Course: I attended an intensive course led by an expert Agile trainer, which provided hands-on insights into Scrum’s roles, events, and artifacts.

* [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html): The free, 13-page Scrum Guide is the cornerstone of PSM I prep. I read it multiple times to internalize its principles.

* Practice Tests: Free mock exams from Scrum.org, these are a 40 question mock tests with many questions similar to the real exam. I aimed to score 100% twice in a row before doing the real test.

**Tip:** Understand how Scrum principles apply in practice, not just the theory in the Guide.

## The PSM I Exam

The PSM I exam is a 60-minute, 80-question multiple-choice test requiring an 85% passing score. Taken online, it tests theoretical knowledge and practical application. Some questions are straightforward, while others involve analyzing scenarios to select the “most Scrum” solution.

I found the exam challenging but passed on my first attempt. My advice:

* Read Carefully: Look out for tricky wording in answer choices.
* Manage Time: Aim for ~45 seconds per question to stay on pace.
* Trust the Scrum Guide: Its wording guides correct answers.
* Remember the pillars of scrum transparency, inspection, and adaptation

## What I Gained

Earning PSM I boosted my confidence in leading in my role as a senior developer on a scrum team. I now know some techniques and hopefully will be able to bring some benefits to my team. The first thing I am going to try out are the alternative retro ideas, like the sailboat below to help spark conversations about how we can improve our processes.
